# pig_game
This is the pig game where your goal is to beat the other players by rolling dice. Upon rolling 2-6, the number is added to the current streak, you have the option to roll to get a higher streak, or holding - meaning your current streak is added to
your score, and it's the other player's turn. But if you roll a 1, the streak becomes 0 and you miss your turn
